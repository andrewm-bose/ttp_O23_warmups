-- HINT: For all of these exercises, you'll need to google
-- *postgres's* standard deviation function.
-- There's 3, 1 of them doesn't work, and one of them is more
-- appropriate. Try to pick the best one.

-- hint: see documentation for the standard deviation function:
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-aggregate.html

-- NOTE: stddev_samp is more valid of a choice, because in the 
-- future we will have more customers, so the data in our database
-- is a "sample", and not the total population of all the customers
-- that could be out there. If this is confusing, don't worry, we
-- haven't covered that yet.

-- Get the average and standard deviation of purchase amounts 
-- in our database.
-- Write down these numbers.
SELECT AVG(amount), stddev_samp(amount)
FROM payment;

-- Get the average purchase per employee, as well as the standard
-- deviation.

-- Write down these numbers.

-- Based on these numbers, do you think there's any meaningful
-- difference between the natural of transactions they handle?

SELECT staff_id, AVG(amount), stddev_samp(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id;

-- Get the average purchase for each customer, as well as the standard
-- deviation.

-- Which customer is the most / least predictable in their behavior?
-- hint: think about standard deviation.
-- MOST....
SELECT customer_id, AVG(amount), stddev_samp(amount) as std
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY std DESC
LIMIT 1;
-- LEAST....
SELECT customer_id, AVG(amount), stddev_samp(amount) as std
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY std
LIMIT 1;

-- what is the average and standard deviation for the number of 
-- purchases per customer?

-- Based on this, can you say anything about 'typical' customer
-- behavior? (For the sake of this, let's assume all purchases
-- were made in the past year.)
-- Don't need to be super specific about this.
WITH transactions_per_customer as (
	SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*)
	FROM payment
	GROUP BY customer_id)
SELECT AVG(count), stddev_samp(count)
FROM transactions_per_customer

-- Most of our customers made between 19 and 29 purchases
-- in the past year. OR
